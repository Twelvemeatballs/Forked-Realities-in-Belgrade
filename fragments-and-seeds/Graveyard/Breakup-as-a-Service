Narrator uses iApp Generator to build (generate?) an app for “managing emotional closure”.
Scaffolding created by the app: template to be personalised.
Selling point: Runs in a TEE to allow for secure, private, emotional data processing.
Enclave: secure portion of memory isolated from the rest of the system.
