OK, what we got?

Kai reviews




**HeartProtocol DAO**
Title: Feels like home
5 stars

Update: Reevaluating core contributions post-cohabitation. 
We used to make decisions on the roof under the stars, drinking yerba mate and arguing about multi-level structures that aren’t about entrenching power. Suddenly there was a motion onchain to remove me as Emotional Liaison. Apparently you can get dumped via snapshot. Would not recommend cohabiting with your core contributors.
1 star

**SoulStack DAO**
Title: Out of alignment
It was a retreat. There was a bonfire. I might have been on the rebound. We had a vision board. We had mood tokens. Now I guess we just have governance token and no vibes. Going to avoid joining another DAO until I’ve been emotionally audited.
2 stars

**Camp ReFiHarmony**
Title: Nature is healing. I am not.
No phones allowed. They made me burn my seed phrase in a cleansing fire circle. We sang songs about consensus. Someone offered to rebalance my energy portfolio. They gave me a POAP for “emotional throughput”. 
3 stars

**LayerZeroGravity Incubator**
Title:  Disappointing
You sleep in pods and eat meal-replacement slurry. Everyone wears the same t-shirt and says things like “XXX is a mindset”. I arrived with a sleeping bag and left with four co-founders and an app I don’t believe in.
2 stars

**FeelingWellness.app**
Title: Misleading claims
Not actually interoperable with DAO trauma. I don’t think it’s unreasonable for me to long for community, connection and something vaguely spiritual that combines regen with degen. Therapist claimed that governance disputes are not a legitimate cause for grieving. Claimed I was projecting. Is that like delegating?
1 star


**Digital Detox DAO**
Title: Still not detoxed
Some guy stood up and shouted “I don’t want to disrupt anything!” and they handed him a grant. I fell in love with someone during the zero-knowledge icebreaker, but it turns out she was shilling a wallet extension. Better than trying to explain gas fees to a therapist, but not by much.
2 stars

**MetaYurt 2.0**
Title: Post-capitalist Burning Man vibes
I met a guy in the ceramics tent who said I reminded him of the Solana outage. We kissed during a bonding ceremony involving fermented agave and shared root access. Someone named Parsley invited me to co-parent an NFT goat. 
Unclear if I got dumped or just lost quorum. 

Collective Feedback Review: **KaiTheNomad.eth (participant)**
Title: Kept talking about his old DAO/Would not fork again
We tried to hold space for him. He kept referring to it as emotional beta-testing.
He left after two days and uploaded a 1-star review to IPFS.
He took the goat.
