Stars Are Not a Consensus Mechanism

**HeartProtocol DAO**
Title: Feels like home
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Updated**: Reevaluating core contributions post-cohabitation. </br>
We used to make decisions on the roof under the stars, drinking yerba mate and arguing about multi-level structures that aren’t about entrenching power. Suddenly there was a motion onchain to remove me as Emotional Liaison. Apparently you can get dumped via snapshot. Would not recommend cohabiting with your core contributors. Exited at full treasury value.

**SoulStack DAO**
Title: Out of alignment  
It was a retreat. There was a bonfire. I might have been on the rebound. Our vision board was minted as an NFT and then fractionalized. I only own 3% of my own dreams now. No vibes. Going to avoid joining another DAO until I’ve been emotionally audited. Kept the mood tokens.  
⭐⭐

**Camp ReFiHarmony**
Title: Nature is healing. I am not.  
No phones allowed. I had to burn my seed phrase in a cleansing fire circle. We sang songs about consensus. Someone offered to rebalance my energy portfolio. They gave me a POAP for “emotional throughput”. I pretended I had a migraine and left. Didn’t realise the multisig candle requires two cosigners to light.  
⭐⭐⭐

**LayerZeroGravity Incubator**
Title:  Extremely mid  
You sleep in pods. No kitchen, just meal-replacement slurry. Everyone wears the same t-shirt and says things like “Exit liquidity is a mindset”. I arrived with a sleeping bag and left with four co-founders and an app I don’t believe in.  
⭐⭐

**FeelingWellness.app**
Title: Misleading claims  
Not actually interoperable with DAO trauma. I don’t think it’s unreasonable for me to long for community, connection and something vaguely spiritual that combines regen with degen. Therapist claimed I was an emotional vampire projecting my feelings onto others. Is that like delegating?  
⭐

**Digital Detox DAO**
Title: Not detoxed, actually  
Some guy stood up and shouted “I don’t want to disrupt anything!” and they handed him a grant. I fell in love with someone during the zero-knowledge icebreaker, but it turns out she was shilling a wallet extension. Taught her about extractable value. Better than trying to explain gas fees to a therapist, but not by much.  
⭐⭐

**MetaYurt 2.0**
Title: Post-capitalist Burning Man vibes  
Met a guy in the ceramics tent who said I reminded him of the Solana outage. We kissed during a bonding ceremony involving fermented agave and shared root access. Someone named Parsley invited me to co-parent an NFT goat. Unclear if I got dumped or just lost quorum.   
⭐⭐⭐

Collective Feedback Review: **KaiTheNomad.eth (participant)**  
Title: Kept talking about his old DAO  
We tried to hold space for him  
He kept referring to it as emotional beta-testing  
He left after two days and uploaded a 1-star review to IPFS  
He took the goat  
Would not fork again
