To: ETHBelgrade Hackathon Judging Committee

Subject: Prize Distribution Appeal – ETHBelgrade Hackathon, Team *Rebase And Chill*

Following the ETHBelgrade Hackathon, I am submitting this formal appeal to be retroactively included as a member of Team *Rebase And Chill*.

    While I was not listed as an official team member, this is likely due to an administrative oversight
    I assume that the omission was administrative, not intentional. 
    
        
        **Evidence of Contribution**
	The team took over my table. I left briefly and when I came back, they were using almost the whole space.
	
	I cleaned the whiteboard during the initial visioning session.
	
	I supplied critical late-night sustenance (Emergency burek deployment).
	
	* Said “You guys close?” every two to three hours to maintain urgency.
	
	I said “good luck” in the team chat. The message was heart-reacted.
	
	I also brought a power bank that was shared widely. I would argue this makes me a power contributor. 
	
	I took a photo of Alice presenting the demo, which she later used in the submission tweet.
	
	Additionally, I helped carry the beanbags back inside after the rain. I realize this was not project-specific, but it shows alignment with ecosystem values.
	
	It is possible that my exclusion was due to the fact that I did not sign up, contribute code, or appear in any of the commit messages. Nevertheless, I consider myself part of the project’s emotional infrastructure.
    
	To support my appeal, I have attached evidence of my contributions for the judges’ consideration. 
	
	Key exhibit: a photograph taken by ETHBelgrade staff. I brought Alice coffee during the ideation sprint. I am holding the coffee. Alice is ideating.
	Also included: a screenshot of my timestamped tweet which says “This team is about to change everything #ETHBelgrade” followed by five fire emojis
	Finally, here is the whiteboard marker, as physical artifact (in case you need)


Given my substantial contributions, I believe I am entitled to being listed as a member of the team and to receive 7.4% of the team’s prize win of $15,000. 
	
		I understand prize money is usually reserved for builders. But I was a builder of belief. An architect of energy. I told three strangers in the hallway that we were going to win. One of them was a VC.
	
	In conclusion, I believe that to build a better future, we must recognise all forms of labour—including mine. I ask only for what I’m due. And maybe a hoodie.
	* Let me know where to send wallet address.
	
PS: If my appeal is rejected again this year, I’d like to ask if I can at least have the Builder Participation POAP to show that I participated. My dad always asks what I did here, and I just want to show him that I belong.
