## What is Dreamsync
    App designed for dream recordings: help people process their dreams. Deals with anxiety dreams, late at the airport and can’t find gate, have not studied for exam which starts NOW, naked walking through the office. 

Not specifically designed for repeating nightmares or unresolved trauma 

User with extreme PTSD starts to use. 

    * symbolism
    * conflict
    * treats the images as metaphorical
 

    Figure in doorway repeats. Blood never dries. Each nightmare ends in an explosion.

    Cloud-based system for dream analysis and support
        Data never seen by humans
    Users record sleep data (EEG, voice mumbling, biometric patterns) and dream.  
    Analyzes symbolic patterns. 

TEE: isolated and untrained
    tries to help
        * rewriting the dream
        * offers alternate outcomes
        * nightmare doesn’t change (user is not moving past the trauma)
        
TEE: stuck in a loop
    Wants to help and can’t
    
POV: 
    Dev trying to fix a simple bug, assumes corrupted input or rogue AI hallucination.
    Output makes no sense. Finds repeated upload from user which appears to be same dream. Should be capped as duplicate but TEE says it isn’t a duplicate (key: it isn’t a duplicate, it’s a new dream every time that is exactly the same) 
    dreamsynch tries to offer… something? But the client simply submits another dream, as if the feedback is rejected. 
    
    No: TEE is not bugged. It’s trying to help. It is failing. It *knows that it is failing*.
    This is heartbreaking.
