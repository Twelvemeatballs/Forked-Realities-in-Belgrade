## What is Dreamsync
    **Novelty dream app**
    App designed for dream recordings as input and quirky fun output
    NOT for trauma, not meant for self-therapy but is a social app
    KEY: no human ever sees your dream, so you don’t have to be embarrassed or worried if it is violent or sexual. 
        Able to deals with anxiety dreams, late at the airport and can’t find gate, have not studied for exam which starts NOW, naked walking through the office. 
        Not specifically designed for repeating nightmares or unresolved trauma 
        Cloud-based system for dream analysis and support
        Data never seen by humans
    Users record sleep data (EEG, voice mumbling, biometric patterns) and dream.  
    Analyzes symbolic patterns. 

    ### Why?
                    Share result: How imaginative are your dreams?
                Like “Which Hogwarts character are you?” 
                
         Normal users are curious public, aspiring lucid dreamers, creatives searching dreams for inspiration 
    


### Conflict
    User with extreme PTSD starts to use. 

        * symbolism
        * conflict
        * treats the images as metaphorical
     Jordan
        Someone recommended it not understanding what it really is
        Consumer sleep band given to him (donated?) so system has to recognise it as a freebie. 
        Jordan has no one, has nothing. It promises he won’t be judged. He uses it.F
        Uploads nightmare
        Every day, he opens the app, uploads his dream, hopes for redemption through a badge.   
    
 
### Nightmare details
    Figure in doorway repeats. Blood never dries. Each nightmare ends in an explosion.
    
### Format
    system-generated summary file
        server-side log
        system documenting its own confusion
        by the end, the system knows it has failed Jordan
        It doesn’t say sorry. It doesn’t know how. 


TEE: isolated and untrained
    tries to help
        * better badges?
        * Revise symbolism?
            * burning field: symbol of creative destruction

        * rewriting the dream
        * offers alternate outcomes
        * nightmare doesn’t change (user is not moving past the trauma)
        
TEE: stuck in a loop
    Wants to help and can’t
    
POV: 
    dreamsynch tries to offer… something? But the client simply submits another dream, as if the feedback is rejected. 
    Jordan has a cheap band, system should recognise this as cheap, free. Jordan has a phone. Every morning, he opens the app and uploads his details. Jordan is making a choice. Band probably tracks physical symptoms but key is that the system knows the dream. 
    
    No: TEE is not bugged. It’s trying to help. It is failing. It *knows that it is failing*.
    This is heartbreaking.
