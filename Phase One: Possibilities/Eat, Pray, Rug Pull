OK, what we got?

Kai reviews




**HeartProtocol DAO**
Title: Feels like home
5 stars.

Update: Reevaluating core contributions post-cohabitation. 
We used to make decisions on the roof under the stars, drinking yerba mate and arguing about multi-level structures that aren’t about entrenching power. Now there’s a motion onchain to remove me as Emotional Liaison. Apparently you can get dumped via snapshot. 
1 star

**SoulStack DAO**
Title: Maybe it’s me
It was a retreat. There was a bonfire. I might have been on the rebound. We had a vision board. We had mood tokens. Now I guess we just have governance token and no vibes. Going to avoid joining another DAO until I’ve been emotionally audited.
2 stars


**Dr Vivek Schmidt, therapist**
Title: Avoid at all costs
Web3 reboundee, joined a purpose-driven DAO because I wanted community, connection and something vaguely spiritual that combines regen with degen. When it all imploded, my therapist claimed that governance disputes are not a legitimate cause for grieving. 
One star.

**Camp ReFiHarmony**
Title: Nature is healing. I am not.
No phones allowed. They made me burn my seed phrase in a cleansing fire circle. We sang songs about consensus. Someone offered to rebalance my energy portfolio. They gave me a POAP for “emotional throughput”. Better than trying to explain gas fees to a therapist, but not much.
3 stars. 

**LayerZeroGravity Incubator**
Title:  Disappointing
You sleep in pods and eat meal-replacement slurry. Everyone wears the same hoodie. I arrived with a sleeping bag and left with four co-founders and an app I don’t believe in.
2 stars.

MetaYurt 2.0
Title: Post-capitalist Burning Man vibes
I met a guy in the ceramics tent who said I reminded him of the Solana outage. We kissed during a bonding ceremony involving fermented agave and shared root access. Someone named Parsley invited me to co-parent an NFT goat. 
Unclear if I got dumped or just lost quorum. 

Digital Detox Retreat
Title: Still not detoxed
Some guy stood up and shouted “I don’t want to disrupt anything!” and they handed him a grant. I fell in love with someone during the zero-knowledge icebreaker, but it turns out she was shilling a wallet extension.
