    **Data**
            **DataProtector** is an end‑to‑end encryption tool that protects data in a TEE. 
            **iApp Generator** is a standalone CLI tool that scaffolds, tests, and deploys SGX/TDX‑ready iExec applications capable of processing Protected Data in a confidential and private environment.
            **[Confidential AI](https://www.iex.ec/confidential-ai)** is not a tool but a merger between confidential computing and AI.
            Challenge: Build the most innovative iApp and find a new confidential data processing use case.
                We expect builders to pick a use‑case where sensitive data must be processed privately with or without AI (for example a KYC passport check, encrypted medical record, or biometric liveness proof)
                The dataset has to be protected and shared (and can be monetized) through Data Protector, then computed inside an iExec application that you scaffold and deploy with iApp Generator.
                Sensitive data, private processing, person remains in control of their data, AI/automation interactions
           iExec makes TEEs usable by real humans: access to secure bubble
