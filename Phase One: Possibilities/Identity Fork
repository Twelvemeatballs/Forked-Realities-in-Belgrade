Polkadot: Identity Forking
Individual blockchains have their own tokens and government. Complex identity structures. Cross-chain interactions. Required to synchornise and manage fragmented identities. 

People are born (assigned?) to a parachain. Chains define langauge, social customs, legal frameworks, dating protocols. Some people fork themselves to try to spread across multiple chains to optimize different trains. But the more chains that you use, the more fragmented you become.

Narrator: single-chain idealist who goes on a pilgrimage to find her sister, using Polkadot’s relay system. Every jump she makes strips assumptions and reconfigures her memory.

My grandparents always told me stories about when there was only one chain and everyone was on it. They are pretty old fashioned. I don’t know if believe that it was really one chain. Where did the languages come from, the religions, the social customs? Where did cross-chain travel come from? But I like to hear the stories. 

I was born on Silene, a legacy chain. Good uptime (stable). It’s not a bad place. A bit boring, I guess. That’s what my sister said. Vridia. She called Silene a Boomer Chain, old-time slang to show just how backwater we were. 

Vridia started to avoid syncing. Mom caught her at the relays, trying to pass for old enough for cross-chain travel. 

I guess she convinced someone because she’s gone now. Our last successful sync ended mid-sentence. After that: silence. 

Sometimes I forget why I started. The systems do that: strip your memories for better performance, optimized for the here and now. Vridia probably doesn’t even remember me. Won’t understand why I’m there, standing in front of her. 


I don’t store memories in-system anymore. Took risky. Some chains overwrite. Others archive everything and charge you to forget. 


There’s problems with this, of course. I’ve started finding signs that I’m a copy: a name rendered wrong. A memory of a place I’ve never been. I think one fragment tried to delete me. 

I have analog backups in a sealed notebook that grandfather gave me. Ink never forks. Except that if I’m the copy, it must have. 

My (decentralised ID) says I’m on a pilgrimage, exploring chains on a voyage of self-discovery. My notebook says it’s a one-woman search party.

But the systems were never meant to reunite anyone. They were built to let go.
