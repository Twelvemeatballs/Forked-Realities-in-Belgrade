Dispute resolution
    I took part in this and I’m not getting credit
    I thought we were shipping together
    performative grievance
A participant who did nothing tries to argue vibes and pizza delivery means he should get a share. 
    Pushed one empty commit to establish presence in git history
    “I was just your warm-up repo”
I should get a share of the winnings from my team who deserted me.
    Team: Francesco, Alice, Vivek, Achebe
Proof
   * Procured critical late-night sustenance (see: “burek diplomacy”).
	* Offered the best memes
	* Cleaned the whiteboard during initial visioning session 
	* Facilitated dopamine distribution via memes.
	* Said “we’re shipping” every 4 hours to maintain urgency.
	* Created the team Notion page (unfilled, but symbolic).
	* Took a photo of Alice presenting the demo, which she later used in the submission tweet.
	* I lent my power bank. Without me, three of those commits don’t happen.
	* I did not attend the final demo, but I watched the recording and messaged “🔥” in the Telegram thread within 90 seconds.
Attached Evidence
	* I brought Alice coffee during the ideation sprint. See attached photo: I am holding the coffee. Alice is ideating.
	* Screenshot of my “you got this 💪” Slack message
	* Photo of my backpack near their table
	* Timestamped tweet: “This team is about to change everything 💥💥💥 #ETHBelgrade”
Wanted
	* 17% share of winnings
	* I am willing to be listed as “founding non-coding emotional co-contributor.”
	* I do not wish to be held accountable for bugs, missed deadlines, or the naming of the repo (sick-protocol-v3-finalFINAL2 was not my idea).
	* Closing Statement: To build a better future, we must recognise all forms of labour—including mine. I ask only for what I’m due, and maybe a hoodie.
	
	
	I understand prize money is usually reserved for builders. But I was a builder of belief. An architect of energy. I told three strangers in the hallway that we were going to win. One of them was a VC.
