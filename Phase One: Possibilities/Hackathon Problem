Dispute resolution
    I took part in this and I’m not getting credit
    I thought we were shipping together
    performative grievance
A participant who did nothing tries to argue vibes and pizza delivery means he should get a share. 
    Pushed one empty commit to establish presence in git history
    “I was just your warm-up repo”
I should get a share of the winnings from my team who deserted me.
    Team: Francesco, Alice, Vivek, Achebe
    Following the ETHBelgrade Hackathon, I’d like to formally submit my case for inclusion in Team Builderz’s prize distribution.
    Although my name was not listed on the final submission, I was spiritually embedded in the project lifecycle.
    While I was not listed as an official team member, this is likely due to an administrative oversight caused by the fact that I did not sign up, contribute code, or appear in any of the documentation. Nevertheless, I consider myself part of the project’s emotional infrastructure.
    	
	I understand prize money is usually reserved for builders. But I was a builder of belief. An architect of energy. I told three strangers in the hallway that we were going to win. One of them was a VC.

Proof
	* The team used my table. I left briefly and when I came back, the laptop farm had bloomed.
    * Cleaned the whiteboard during initial visioning session 
	* Created the team Notion page (unfilled, but symbolic).
    * Procured critical late-night sustenance (see: “burek diplomacy”).
	* Said “we’re shipping” every 4 hours to maintain urgency.
	* I stood guard while the team sprinted the deployment. Nobody asked me to, but the vibe was tense and I didn’t want to break flow.
	* I said “good luck” in the team chat. The message was heart-reacted.
	* I lent my power bank. Without me, three of those commits don’t happen.
	* I also brought a power bank that was shared widely. I would argue this makes me a power contributor.
	* Took a photo of Alice presenting the demo, which she later used in the submission tweet.
	* I did not attend the final demo, but I watched the recording and messaged “🔥” in the Telegram thread within 90 seconds.
	* Additionally, I helped carry the beanbags back inside after the rain. I realize this was not project-specific, but it shows alignment with ecosystem values.

Attached Evidence
	* I brought Alice coffee during the ideation sprint. See attached photo: I am holding the coffee. Alice is ideating.
	* Screenshot of my “you got this 💪” Slack message
	* Photo of my backpack near their table
	* Timestamped tweet: “This team is about to change everything 💥💥💥 #ETHBelgrade”
	* The whiteboard marker, as physical artifact (in case you need)
Wanted
	* 17% share of winnings
	* Given these substantial inputs, I believe I am entitled to 7.4% of the prize split.
	* I am not requesting a full share—just a fair allocation based on these high-leverage interventions. 7.4% seems proportionate. 
	
	* I am willing to be listed as “founding non-coding emotional co-contributor.”
	* I do not wish to be held accountable for bugs, missed deadlines, or the naming of the repo (sick-protocol-v3-finalFINAL2 was not my idea).
	
Conclusion	
	* Closing Statement: To build a better future, we must recognise all forms of labour—including mine. I ask only for what I’m due, and maybe a hoodie.
	* Let me know where to send wallet address.
	
[Name withheld pending arbitration outcome]
PS: if found abgainst me, I would like to at least get the Builder POAP to show that I participated.
