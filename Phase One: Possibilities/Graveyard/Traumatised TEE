* Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) keeps secrets, isolated from rest of systems: what if traumatised?

TEE starts patterning on data like a haunted processor.

Warning: detected emotional recursion in dataset processing.
Suggestion: deploy secondary support TEE for co-processing.

TEE is resisting certain inputs because it has learned what pain looks like.
